##CyberPlant I2Ciso

The I2Ciso Module are hot swappable digital isolators with nonlatching, bidirectional communication channels that
are compatible with I2C interfaces. This eliminates the need for
splitting I2C signals into separate transmit and receive signals
for use with standalone optocouplers. The I2Ciso Module provides two bidirectional channels, supporting a complete isolated I2C interface.

##Features:

- Regulated 3.3 V or 5 V output
- Up to 500 mW output power
- Bidirectional I2C communication
- input-output pull up switches 4k7
- I2C port compatible with Grove
- PCB Size : 36.8 mm√ó20.3 mm


## Applications


- Isolated sensor interfaces
- Isolated I2C, SMBus, or PMBus interfaces
- Multilevel I2C interfaces
- Power supplies
- Networking
- RS-232/RS-422/RS-485 transceivers

## Regulated 3.3 V or 5 V output

**5V**(default):
 
**VDD Input | Viso Output**
